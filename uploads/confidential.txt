Dear Staff,
This email contains confidential information and should only be shared with staff members on a need-to-know basis. We are planning a surprise student emergency drill on 21/6/24 at 13:00. The scenario will simulate a fire drill
The objectives of this drill are to:
Test our emergency response procedures.
Ensure the safety and well-being of our students and staff.
Minimize confusion and panic during an actual emergency.
Please refrain from discussing this drill with students or parents to maintain the element of surprise. Detailed instructions and specific roles for staff will be provided in a separate email closer to the drill date.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,
